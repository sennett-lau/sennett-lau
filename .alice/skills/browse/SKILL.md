  Fast headless browser for QA testing and site dogfooding. Navigate any URL, interact with
  elements, verify page state, diff before/after actions, take annotated screenshots, check
  responsive layouts, test forms and uploads, handle dialogs, and assert element states.
  ~100ms per command. Use when you need to test a feature, verify a deployment, dogfood a
  user flow, or file a bug with evidence. Use when asked to "open in browser", "test the
  site", "take a screenshot", or "dogfood this".
allowed-tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
  - AskUserQuestion

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
# Project-local state dir — all session data under .alice/mem/ (gitignored).
eval "$(.alice/bin/alice-slug 2>/dev/null || true)"
mkdir -p "${ROOT:-.}/.alice/mem"
echo "BRANCH: ${BRANCH:-unknown}"
```

# browse: QA Testing & Dogfooding

## Overview

Persistent headless Chromium primitives for fast browser QA, interaction, screenshots, snapshots, console checks, and network inspection.

## When to Use

- Use when asked to open a URL, test a site, take a screenshot, dogfood a flow, verify page state, or gather browser evidence.
- Use when another skill needs raw browser primitives rather than a full QA sweep.
- Use when validating responsive layouts, forms, uploads, dialogs, auth state, or post-action DOM changes.

**When NOT to use:**

- Do not use for non-browser code paths or pure backend/unit-test verification.
- Do not use when a full test-and-fix QA loop is needed; use `qa` instead.
- Do not use before running the setup check and confirming the browse binary is ready.

## Process

Persistent headless Chromium. First call auto-starts (~3s), then ~100ms per command.
State persists between calls (cookies, tabs, login sessions).

### SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.alice/skills/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.alice/skills/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=.alice/skills/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "alice browse needs a one-time build (~10–30 seconds; will install bun first if missing). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. On approval, run the bundled setup script:
   ```bash
   .alice/skills/browse/setup
   ```
   The script auto-installs bun if missing (with SHA-256 checksum verification), runs `bun install`, and compiles the binary via `bun run build`. Output lands at `.alice/skills/browse/dist/browse`.
3. Re-run the SETUP check above to confirm `READY:`.

### Core QA Patterns

### 1. Verify a page loads correctly
```bash
$B goto https://yourapp.com
$B text                          # content loads?
$B console                       # JS errors?
$B network                       # failed requests?
$B is visible ".main-content"    # key elements present?
```

### 2. Test a user flow
```bash
$B goto https://app.com/login
$B snapshot -i                   # see all interactive elements
$B fill @e3 "user@test.com"
$B fill @e4 "password"
$B click @e5                     # submit
$B snapshot -D                   # diff: what changed after submit?
$B is visible ".dashboard"       # success state present?
```

### 3. Verify an action worked
```bash
$B snapshot                      # baseline
$B click @e3                     # do something
$B snapshot -D                   # unified diff shows exactly what changed
```

### 4. Visual evidence for bug reports
```bash
$B snapshot -i -a -o /tmp/annotated.png   # labeled screenshot
$B screenshot /tmp/bug.png                # plain screenshot
$B console                                # error log
```

### 5. Find all clickable elements (including non-ARIA)
```bash
$B snapshot -C                   # finds divs with cursor:pointer, onclick, tabindex
$B click @c1                     # interact with them
```

### 6. Assert element states
```bash
$B is visible ".modal"
$B is enabled "#submit-btn"
$B is disabled "#submit-btn"
$B is checked "#agree-checkbox"
$B is editable "#name-field"
$B is focused "#search-input"
$B js "document.body.textContent.includes('Success')"
```

### 7. Test responsive layouts
```bash
$B responsive /tmp/layout        # mobile + tablet + desktop screenshots
$B viewport 375x812              # or set specific viewport
$B screenshot /tmp/mobile.png
```

### 8. Test file uploads
```bash
$B upload "#file-input" /path/to/file.pdf
$B is visible ".upload-success"
```

### 9. Test dialogs
```bash
$B dialog-accept "yes"           # set up handler
$B click "#delete-button"        # trigger dialog
$B dialog                        # see what appeared
$B snapshot -D                   # verify deletion happened
```

### 10. Compare environments
```bash
$B diff https://staging.app.com https://prod.app.com
```

### 11. Show screenshots to the user
After `$B screenshot`, `$B snapshot -a -o`, or `$B responsive`, always use the Read tool on the output PNG(s) so the user can see them. Without this, screenshots are invisible.

### User Handoff

When you hit something you can't handle in headless mode (CAPTCHA, complex auth, multi-factor
login), hand off to the user:

```bash
# 1. Open a visible Chrome at the current page
$B handoff "Stuck on CAPTCHA at login page"

# 2. Tell the user what happened (via AskUserQuestion)
#    "I've opened Chrome at the login page. Please solve the CAPTCHA
#     and let me know when you're done."

# 3. When user says "done", re-snapshot and continue
$B resume
```

**When to use handoff:**
- CAPTCHAs or bot detection
- Multi-factor authentication (SMS, authenticator app)
- OAuth flows that require user interaction
- Complex interactions the AI can't handle after 3 attempts

The browser preserves all state (cookies, localStorage, tabs) across the handoff.
After `resume`, you get a fresh snapshot of wherever the user left off.

### Snapshot Flags

The snapshot is your primary tool for understanding and interacting with pages.

```
-i        --interactive           Interactive elements only (buttons, links, inputs) with @e refs
-c        --compact               Compact (no empty structural nodes)
-d <N>    --depth                 Limit tree depth (0 = root only, default: unlimited)
-s <sel>  --selector              Scope to CSS selector
-D        --diff                  Unified diff against previous snapshot (first call stores baseline)
-a        --annotate              Annotated screenshot with red overlay boxes and ref labels
-o <path> --output                Output path for annotated screenshot (default: <temp>/browse-annotated.png)
-C        --cursor-interactive    Cursor-interactive elements (@c refs — divs with pointer, onclick)
```

All flags can be combined freely. `-o` only applies when `-a` is also used.
Example: `$B snapshot -i -a -C -o /tmp/annotated.png`

**Ref numbering:** @e refs are assigned sequentially (@e1, @e2, ...) in tree order.
@c refs from `-C` are numbered separately (@c1, @c2, ...).

After snapshot, use @refs as selectors in any command:
```bash
$B click @e3       $B fill @e4 "value"     $B hover @e1
$B html @e2        $B css @e5 "color"      $B attrs @e6
$B click @c1       # cursor-interactive ref (from -C)
```

**Output format:** indented accessibility tree with @ref IDs, one element per line.
```
  @e1 [heading] "Welcome" [level=1]
  @e2 [textbox] "Email"
  @e3 [button] "Submit"
```

Refs are invalidated on navigation — run `snapshot` again after `goto`.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The page rendered something, so it works." | "Rendered" ≠ "correct". Check console for errors, network for failed requests, and the actual DOM for the elements the feature claims to produce. |
| "I'll skip the snapshot and just look at the screenshot." | Screenshots show pixels; snapshots show interactive structure. Click targets, form fields, and ARIA hooks live in the snapshot, not the image. Use both. |
| "Re-running browse to inspect would burn tool calls." | Each browse call is ~100ms warm. Re-checking after an action is cheap; assuming the action worked is expensive when it didn't. |
| "The login worked in browse, so the user's flow works." | The headless session can have a different cookie/session shape than the user's real browser. For auth-sensitive bug repros, use `setup-browser-cookies` to mirror the real session. |
| "Diffing snapshots is overkill for this small interaction." | The diff catches what you didn't notice changed (a hidden modal appeared, a CSP warning fired, a network call regressed). Default to `-D` after every meaningful action. |

## Red Flags

- Reporting "feature works" without console + network checks.
- Skipping the SETUP block and assuming the binary is present.
- Running browse against production without explicit user permission for destructive actions.
- Asserting visibility on an element ref captured from a stale snapshot (refs invalidate on re-render).
- Closing or restarting the server mid-session without preserving in-flight state.
- Pasting cookie values or session tokens into chat output.

## Verification

After a browse-driven check:

- [ ] SETUP returned `READY:` (binary present, build not needed mid-run).
- [ ] Console was inspected — no unexpected errors.
- [ ] Network was inspected — no failed requests on the page under test.
- [ ] Key elements verified visible (`is visible "<selector>"`).
- [ ] If an action was taken, a `snapshot -D` diff was produced against the pre-action snapshot.
- [ ] Screenshots saved for any user-visible report are referenced by file path in the output.
- [ ] Session state (cookies, tabs) is left in a clean state for the next caller, or deliberately preserved with a note saying why.
