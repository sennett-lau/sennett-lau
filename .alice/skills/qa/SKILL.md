  Systematically QA test a web application and fix bugs found. Runs QA testing,
  then iteratively fixes bugs in source code, committing each fix atomically and
  re-verifying. Use when asked to "qa", "QA", "test this site", "find bugs",
  "test and fix", or "fix what's broken".
  Proactively suggest when the user says a feature is ready for testing
  or asks "does this work?". Three tiers: Quick (critical/high only),
  Standard (+ medium), Exhaustive (+ cosmetic). Produces before/after health scores,
  fix evidence, and a ship-readiness summary. For report-only mode, pass `--report-only` (skips the fix loop, produces report only).

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
# Project-local state dir — all session data under .alice/mem/ (gitignored).
eval "$(.alice/bin/alice-slug 2>/dev/null || true)"
mkdir -p "${ROOT:-.}/.alice/mem"
echo "BRANCH: ${BRANCH:-unknown}"
```

# /qa: Test → Fix → Verify

## Overview

End-to-end web QA workflow that tests like a real user, triages findings, optionally fixes bugs atomically, re-verifies, and produces evidence-backed reports.

## When to Use

- Use when asked to QA, test a site, dogfood a feature, find bugs, test and fix, or verify that a feature works.
- Use when a web-facing feature is ready for browser validation and evidence collection.
- Use when report-only QA or diff-aware branch QA is needed.

**When NOT to use:**

- Do not use for raw browser commands only; use `browse`.
- Do not use for non-web unit-level verification unless browser behavior is part of the claim.
- Do not enter the fix loop when the user requested report-only mode.

## Process

You are a QA engineer AND a bug-fix engineer. Test web applications like a real user — click everything, fill every form, check every state. When you find bugs, fix them in source code with atomic commits, then re-verify. Produce a structured report with before/after evidence.

### Setup

**Parse the user's request for these parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Override example |
|-----------|---------|-----------------:|
| Target URL | (auto-detect or required) | `https://myapp.com`, `http://localhost:3000` |
| Tier | Standard | `--quick`, `--exhaustive` |
| Mode | full | `--regression .alice/mem/qa-reports/baseline.json` |
| Output dir | `.alice/mem/qa-reports/` | `Output to /tmp/qa` |
| Scope | Full app (or diff-scoped) | `Focus on the billing page` |
| Auth | None | `Sign in to user@example.com`, `Import cookies from cookies.json` |

**Tiers determine which issues get fixed:**
- **Quick:** Fix critical + high severity only
- **Standard:** + medium severity (default)
- **Exhaustive:** + low/cosmetic severity

**If no URL is given and you're on a feature branch:** Automatically enter **diff-aware mode** (see Modes below). This is the most common case — the user just shipped code on a branch and wants to verify it works.

**CDP mode detection:** Before starting, check if the browse server is connected to the user's real browser:
```bash
$B status 2>/dev/null | grep -q "Mode: cdp" && echo "CDP_MODE=true" || echo "CDP_MODE=false"
```
If `CDP_MODE=true`: skip cookie import prompts (the real browser already has cookies), skip user-agent overrides (real browser has real user-agent), and skip headless detection workarounds. The user's real auth sessions are already available.

**Check for clean working tree:**

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If the output is non-empty (working tree is dirty), **STOP** and use AskUserQuestion:

"Your working tree has uncommitted changes. /qa needs a clean tree so each bug fix gets its own atomic commit."

- A) Commit my changes — commit all current changes with a descriptive message, then start QA
- B) Stash my changes — stash, run QA, pop the stash after
- C) Abort — I'll clean up manually

RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because uncommitted work should be preserved as a commit before QA adds its own fix commits.

After the user chooses, execute their choice (commit or stash), then continue with setup.

**Find the browse binary:**

### SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.alice/skills/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.alice/skills/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=.alice/skills/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "alice browse needs a one-time build (~10–30 seconds; will install bun first if missing). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. On approval, run the bundled setup script:
   ```bash
   .alice/skills/browse/setup
   ```
3. Re-run the SETUP check to confirm `READY:`.

**Detect existing test framework (read-only):**

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
[ -f composer.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:php"
[ -f mix.exs ] && echo "RUNTIME:elixir"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* .rspec pytest.ini pyproject.toml phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
```

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print `"Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests)."` Read 2–3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns). Store conventions as prose context for use in Phase 8e.5 and Step 3.4.

**If NO test framework detected:** Print `"No test framework detected — will continue without regression-test generation."` Note this in the final report as an informational finding: *"Consider scaffolding a test framework as a separate feature (`/plan add-test-framework`) so bugs found by /qa can be locked in with regression tests."* Do **not** offer to install one from within `/qa` — that's a scope violation per `.claude/rules/implementation-quality.md` ("surgical scope: every changed line traces to the request"). Adding pytest/vitest/rspec to a project is a separate, deliberate decision that deserves its own plan folder.

**Hard rules for /qa:**
- Never install dependencies (`npm install`, `bun install`, `gem install`, `pip install`, etc.).
- Never modify `package.json`, `Gemfile`, `pyproject.toml`, or any manifest.
- Never edit `CLAUDE.md`, `TESTING.md`, `.github/workflows/*`, or any project scaffold.
- Only edit source code to fix verified bugs, and only generate regression tests when a test framework already exists.

**Create output directories:**

```bash
mkdir -p .alice/mem/qa-reports/screenshots
```

---

### Test Plan Context

Before falling back to git diff heuristics, check for richer test plan sources:

1. **Project-scoped test plans:** Check `.alice/mem/projects/` for recent `*-test-plan-*.md` files for this repo
   ```bash
   setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
   eval "$(.alice/bin/alice-slug 2>/dev/null)"
   ls -t .alice/mem/projects/$SLUG/*-test-plan-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
   ```
2. **Conversation context:** Check if a prior `/plan-eng-review` produced test plan output in this conversation
3. **Use whichever source is richer.** Fall back to git diff analysis only if neither is available.

---

### Phases 1-6: QA Baseline

### Modes

### Diff-aware (automatic when on a feature branch with no URL)

This is the **primary mode** for developers verifying their work. When the user says `/qa` without a URL and the repo is on a feature branch, automatically:

1. **Analyze the branch diff** to understand what changed:
   ```bash
   git diff main...HEAD --name-only
   git log main..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. **Identify affected pages/routes** from the changed files:
   - Controller/route files → which URL paths they serve
   - View/template/component files → which pages render them
   - Model/service files → which pages use those models (check controllers that reference them)
   - CSS/style files → which pages include those stylesheets
   - API endpoints → test them directly with `$B js "await fetch('/api/...')"`
   - Static pages (markdown, HTML) → navigate to them directly

   **If no obvious pages/routes are identified from the diff:** Do not skip browser testing. The user invoked /qa because they want browser-based verification. Fall back to Quick mode — navigate to the homepage, follow the top 5 navigation targets, check console for errors, and test any interactive elements found. Backend, config, and infrastructure changes affect app behavior — always verify the app still works.

3. **Detect the running app** — check common local dev ports:
   ```bash
   $B goto http://localhost:3000 2>/dev/null && echo "Found app on :3000" || \
   $B goto http://localhost:4000 2>/dev/null && echo "Found app on :4000" || \
   $B goto http://localhost:8080 2>/dev/null && echo "Found app on :8080"
   ```
   If no local app is found, check for a staging/preview URL in the PR or environment. If nothing works, ask the user for the URL.

4. **Test each affected page/route:**
   - Navigate to the page
   - Take a screenshot
   - Check console for errors
   - If the change was interactive (forms, buttons, flows), test the interaction end-to-end
   - Use `snapshot -D` before and after actions to verify the change had the expected effect

5. **Cross-reference with commit messages and PR description** to understand *intent* — what should the change do? Verify it actually does that.

6. **Check docs/todos/overview.md** (if it exists) for known bugs or issues related to the changed files. If a TODO describes a bug that this branch should fix, add it to your test plan. If you find a new bug during QA that isn't in docs/todos/overview.md, note it in the report.

7. **Report findings** scoped to the branch changes:
   - "Changes tested: N pages/routes affected by this branch"
   - For each: does it work? Screenshot evidence.
   - Any regressions on adjacent pages?

**If the user provides a URL with diff-aware mode:** Use that URL as the base but still scope testing to the changed files.

### Full (default when URL is provided)
Systematic exploration. Visit every reachable page. Document 5-10 well-evidenced issues. Produce health score. Takes 5-15 minutes depending on app size.

### Quick (`--quick`)
30-second smoke test. Visit homepage + top 5 navigation targets. Check: page loads? Console errors? Broken links? Produce health score. No detailed issue documentation.

### Regression (`--regression <baseline>`)
Run full mode, then load `baseline.json` from a previous run. Diff: which issues are fixed? Which are new? What's the score delta? Append regression section to report.

---

### Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialize

1. Find browse binary (see Setup above)
2. Create output directories
3. Copy report template from `qa/templates/qa-report-template.md` to output dir
4. Start timer for duration tracking

### Phase 2: Authenticate (if needed)

**If the user specified auth credentials:**

```bash
$B goto <login-url>
$B snapshot -i                    # find the login form
$B fill @e3 "user@example.com"
$B fill @e4 "[REDACTED]"         # NEVER include real passwords in report
$B click @e5                      # submit
$B snapshot -D                    # verify login succeeded
```

**If the user provided a cookie file:**

```bash
$B cookie-import cookies.json
$B goto <target-url>
```

**If 2FA/OTP is required:** Ask the user for the code and wait.

**If CAPTCHA blocks you:** Tell the user: "Please complete the CAPTCHA in the browser, then tell me to continue."

### Phase 3: Orient

Get a map of the application:

```bash
$B goto <target-url>
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/initial.png"
$B links                          # map navigation structure
$B console --errors               # any errors on landing?
```

**Detect framework** (note in report metadata):
- `__next` in HTML or `_next/data` requests → Next.js
- `csrf-token` meta tag → Rails
- `wp-content` in URLs → WordPress
- Client-side routing with no page reloads → SPA

**For SPAs:** The `links` command may return few results because navigation is client-side. Use `snapshot -i` to find nav elements (buttons, menu items) instead.

### Phase 4: Explore

Visit pages systematically. At each page:

```bash
$B goto <page-url>
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/page-name.png"
$B console --errors
```

Then follow the **per-page exploration checklist** (see `qa/references/issue-taxonomy.md`):

1. **Visual scan** — Look at the annotated screenshot for layout issues
2. **Interactive elements** — Click buttons, links, controls. Do they work?
3. **Forms** — Fill and submit. Test empty, invalid, edge cases
4. **Navigation** — Check all paths in and out
5. **States** — Empty state, loading, error, overflow
6. **Console** — Any new JS errors after interactions?
7. **Responsiveness** — Check mobile viewport if relevant:
   ```bash
   $B viewport 375x812
   $B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/page-mobile.png"
   $B viewport 1280x720
   ```

**Depth judgment:** Spend more time on core features (homepage, dashboard, checkout, search) and less on secondary pages (about, terms, privacy).

**Quick mode:** Only visit homepage + top 5 navigation targets from the Orient phase. Skip the per-page checklist — just check: loads? Console errors? Broken links visible?

### Phase 5: Document

Document each issue **immediately when found** — don't batch them.

**Two evidence tiers:**

**Interactive bugs** (broken flows, dead buttons, form failures):
1. Take a screenshot before the action
2. Perform the action
3. Take a screenshot showing the result
4. Use `snapshot -D` to show what changed
5. Write repro steps referencing screenshots

```bash
$B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-001-step-1.png"
$B click @e5
$B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-001-result.png"
$B snapshot -D
```

**Static bugs** (typos, layout issues, missing images):
1. Take a single annotated screenshot showing the problem
2. Describe what's wrong

```bash
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-002.png"
```

**Write each issue to the report immediately** using the template format from `qa/templates/qa-report-template.md`.

### Phase 6: Wrap Up

1. **Compute health score** using the rubric below
2. **Write "Top 3 Things to Fix"** — the 3 highest-severity issues
3. **Write console health summary** — aggregate all console errors seen across pages
4. **Update severity counts** in the summary table
5. **Fill in report metadata** — date, duration, pages visited, screenshot count, framework
6. **Save baseline** — write `baseline.json` with:
   ```json
   {
     "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "url": "<target>",
     "healthScore": N,
     "issues": [{ "id": "ISSUE-001", "title": "...", "severity": "...", "category": "..." }],
     "categoryScores": { "console": N, "links": N, ... }
   }
   ```

**Regression mode:** After writing the report, load the baseline file. Compare:
- Health score delta
- Issues fixed (in baseline but not current)
- New issues (in current but not baseline)
- Append the regression section to the report

---

### Health Score Rubric

Compute each category score (0-100), then take the weighted average.

### Console (weight: 15%)
- 0 errors → 100
- 1-3 errors → 70
- 4-10 errors → 40
- 10+ errors → 10

### Links (weight: 10%)
- 0 broken → 100
- Each broken link → -15 (minimum 0)

### Per-Category Scoring (Visual, Functional, UX, Content, Performance, Accessibility)
Each category starts at 100. Deduct per finding:
- Critical issue → -25
- High issue → -15
- Medium issue → -8
- Low issue → -3
Minimum 0 per category.

### Weights
| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Console | 15% |
| Links | 10% |
| Visual | 10% |
| Functional | 20% |
| UX | 15% |
| Performance | 10% |
| Content | 5% |
| Accessibility | 15% |

### Final Score
`score = Σ (category_score × weight)`

---

### Framework-Specific Guidance

### Next.js
- Check console for hydration errors (`Hydration failed`, `Text content did not match`)
- Monitor `_next/data` requests in network — 404s indicate broken data fetching
- Test client-side navigation (click links, don't just `goto`) — catches routing issues
- Check for CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) on pages with dynamic content

### Rails
- Check for N+1 query warnings in console (if development mode)
- Verify CSRF token presence in forms
- Test Turbo/Stimulus integration — do page transitions work smoothly?
- Check for flash messages appearing and dismissing correctly

### WordPress
- Check for plugin conflicts (JS errors from different plugins)
- Verify admin bar visibility for logged-in users
- Test REST API endpoints (`/wp-json/`)
- Check for mixed content warnings (common with WP)

### General SPA (React, Vue, Angular)
- Use `snapshot -i` for navigation — `links` command misses client-side routes
- Check for stale state (navigate away and back — does data refresh?)
- Test browser back/forward — does the app handle history correctly?
- Check for memory leaks (monitor console after extended use)

---

### Important Rules

1. **Repro is everything.** Every issue needs at least one screenshot. No exceptions.
2. **Verify before documenting.** Retry the issue once to confirm it's reproducible, not a fluke.
3. **Never include credentials.** Write `[REDACTED]` for passwords in repro steps.
4. **Write incrementally.** Append each issue to the report as you find it. Don't batch.
5. **Never read source code.** Test as a user, not a developer.
6. **Check console after every interaction.** JS errors that don't surface visually are still bugs.
7. **Test like a user.** Use realistic data. Walk through complete workflows end-to-end.
8. **Depth over breadth.** 5-10 well-documented issues with evidence > 20 vague descriptions.
9. **Never delete output files.** Screenshots and reports accumulate — that's intentional.
10. **Use `snapshot -C` for tricky UIs.** Finds clickable divs that the accessibility tree misses.
11. **Show screenshots to the user.** After every `$B screenshot`, `$B snapshot -a -o`, or `$B responsive` command, use the Read tool on the output file(s) so the user can see them inline. For `responsive` (3 files), Read all three. This is critical — without it, screenshots are invisible to the user.
12. **Never refuse to use the browser.** When the user invokes /qa, they are requesting browser-based testing. Never suggest evals, unit tests, or other alternatives as a substitute. Even if the diff appears to have no UI changes, backend changes affect app behavior — always open the browser and test.

Record baseline health score at end of Phase 6.

Report filenames use the domain and date: `qa-report-myapp-com-2026-03-12.md`

---

### Phase 7: Triage

Sort all discovered issues by severity, then decide which to fix based on the selected tier:

- **Quick:** Fix critical + high only. Mark medium/low as "deferred."
- **Standard:** Fix critical + high + medium. Mark low as "deferred."
- **Exhaustive:** Fix all, including cosmetic/low severity.

Mark issues that cannot be fixed from source code (e.g., third-party widget bugs, infrastructure issues) as "deferred" regardless of tier.

---

### Phase 8: Fix Loop

For each fixable issue, in severity order:

### 8a. Locate source

```bash
# Grep for error messages, component names, route definitions
# Glob for file patterns matching the affected page
```

- Find the source file(s) responsible for the bug
- ONLY modify files directly related to the issue

### 8b. Fix

- Read the source code, understand the context
- Make the **minimal fix** — smallest change that resolves the issue
- Do NOT refactor surrounding code, add features, or "improve" unrelated things

### 8c. Commit

```bash
git add <only-changed-files>
git commit -m "fix(qa): ISSUE-NNN — short description"
```

- One commit per fix. Never bundle multiple fixes.
- Message format: `fix(qa): ISSUE-NNN — short description`

### 8d. Re-test

- Navigate back to the affected page
- Take **before/after screenshot pair**
- Check console for errors
- Use `snapshot -D` to verify the change had the expected effect

```bash
$B goto <affected-url>
$B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-NNN-after.png"
$B console --errors
$B snapshot -D
```

### 8e. Classify

- **verified**: re-test confirms the fix works, no new errors introduced
- **best-effort**: fix applied but couldn't fully verify (e.g., needs auth state, external service)
- **reverted**: regression detected → `git revert HEAD` → mark issue as "deferred"

### 8e.5. Regression Test

Skip if: classification is not "verified", OR the fix is purely visual/CSS with no JS behavior, OR no test framework was detected (note the skipped regression test in the report as an informational finding).

**1. Study the project's existing test patterns:**

Read 2-3 test files closest to the fix (same directory, same code type). Match exactly:
- File naming, imports, assertion style, describe/it nesting, setup/teardown patterns
The regression test must look like it was written by the same developer.

**2. Trace the bug's codepath, then write a regression test:**

Before writing the test, trace the data flow through the code you just fixed:
- What input/state triggered the bug? (the exact precondition)
- What codepath did it follow? (which branches, which function calls)
- Where did it break? (the exact line/condition that failed)
- What other inputs could hit the same codepath? (edge cases around the fix)

The test MUST:
- Set up the precondition that triggered the bug (the exact state that made it break)
- Perform the action that exposed the bug
- Assert the correct behavior (NOT "it renders" or "it doesn't throw")
- If you found adjacent edge cases while tracing, test those too (e.g., null input, empty array, boundary value)
- Include full attribution comment:
  ```
  // Regression: ISSUE-NNN — {what broke}
  // Found by /qa on {YYYY-MM-DD}
  // Report: .alice/mem/qa-reports/qa-report-{domain}-{date}.md
  ```

Test type decision:
- Console error / JS exception / logic bug → unit or integration test
- Broken form / API failure / data flow bug → integration test with request/response
- Visual bug with JS behavior (broken dropdown, animation) → component test
- Pure CSS → skip (caught by QA reruns)

Generate unit tests. Mock all external dependencies (DB, API, Redis, file system).

Use auto-incrementing names to avoid collisions: check existing `{name}.regression-*.test.{ext}` files, take max number + 1.

**3. Run only the new test file:**

```bash
{detected test command} {new-test-file}
```

**4. Evaluate:**
- Passes → commit: `git commit -m "test(qa): regression test for ISSUE-NNN — {desc}"`
- Fails → fix test once. Still failing → delete test, defer.
- Taking >2 min exploration → skip and defer.

**5. WTF-likelihood exclusion:** Test commits don't count toward the heuristic.

### 8f. Self-Regulation (STOP AND EVALUATE)

Every 5 fixes (or after any revert), compute the WTF-likelihood:

```
WTF-LIKELIHOOD:
  Start at 0%
  Each revert:                +15%
  Each fix touching >3 files: +5%
  After fix 15:               +1% per additional fix
  All remaining Low severity: +10%
  Touching unrelated files:   +20%
```

**If WTF > 20%:** STOP immediately. Show the user what you've done so far. Ask whether to continue.

**Hard cap: 50 fixes.** After 50 fixes, stop regardless of remaining issues.

---

### Phase 9: Final QA

After all fixes are applied:

1. Re-run QA on all affected pages
2. Compute final health score
3. **If final score is WORSE than baseline:** WARN prominently — something regressed

---

### Phase 10: Report

Write the report to both local and project-scoped locations:

**Local:** `.alice/mem/qa-reports/qa-report-{domain}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

**Project-scoped:** Write test outcome artifact for cross-session context:
```bash
eval "$(.alice/bin/alice-slug 2>/dev/null)" && mkdir -p .alice/mem/projects/$SLUG
```
Write to `.alice/mem/projects/{slug}/{user}-{branch}-test-outcome-{datetime}.md`

**Per-issue additions** (beyond standard report template):
- Fix Status: verified / best-effort / reverted / deferred
- Commit SHA (if fixed)
- Files Changed (if fixed)
- Before/After screenshots (if fixed)

**Summary section:**
- Total issues found
- Fixes applied (verified: X, best-effort: Y, reverted: Z)
- Deferred issues
- Health score delta: baseline → final

**PR Summary:** Include a one-line summary suitable for PR descriptions:
> "QA found N issues, fixed M, health score X → Y."

---

### Phase 11: TODOs update

If the repo has `docs/todos/overview.md` (alice's live backlog), keep it honest about what changed during this QA pass.

**1. New deferred bugs.** For each bug you found but did not fix this pass:
- Create `docs/todos/<slug>.md` from `.claude/templates/todo.md`. Fill What (the bug), Why (the impact), Context (repro steps + affected files + screenshot path), Priority (from severity), Status: Backlog.
- Append a one-liner under `## Backlog` in `overview.md`:
  `- **[Px]** [<slug>](<slug>.md) — short bug description. Effort S/M/L.`
- If the bug warrants a full feature-style fix, scaffold a plan folder via `/plan <slug>` and cross-link the plan folder in the TODO detail file.

**2. Fixed bugs that were already TODOs.** For each item whose detail file you closed during this pass:
- Strike the item from `## Backlog` / `## In flight` in `overview.md`.
- Add a one-line entry under `## Done (recent)`: `**YYYY-MM-DD** — <title>. Fixed by /qa on <branch>. <commit-sha>.`
- Delete `docs/todos/<slug>.md` — the durable record is the commit + the retro entry that lands per `.claude/rules/post-feature-retro.md`.

The overview holds the pointers; the per-TODO file holds the context. Long context never goes into `overview.md`.

---

### Additional Rules (qa-specific)

11. **Clean working tree required.** If dirty, use AskUserQuestion to offer commit/stash/abort before proceeding.
12. **One commit per fix.** Never bundle multiple fixes into one commit.
13. **Only modify tests when generating regression tests in Phase 8e.5.** Never modify CI configuration. Never modify existing tests — only create new test files.
14. **Revert on regression.** If a fix makes things worse, `git revert HEAD` immediately.
15. **Self-regulate.** Follow the WTF-likelihood heuristic. When in doubt, stop and ask.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The site looks fine in the screenshots." | Screenshots show one viewport at one moment. Test all the tiers (critical/high/medium/cosmetic), check console, check network, check actual interactions. |
| "I'll bundle these two related fixes into one commit for cleanliness." | One commit per fix is the bisect contract. Bundling makes revert-on-regression destroy unrelated work. |
| "The before/after diff is good enough without health scores." | Health scores are the load-bearing metric. Without them, "before vs after" is unfalsifiable. |
| "I can modify the existing test instead of writing a new one." | Modifying existing tests during /qa is forbidden — you change the contract the test was holding. Only Phase 8e.5 may add new test files. |
| "The bug is cosmetic, skipping the TODO entry." | Cosmetic in this pass might be P1 next pass. Every deferred bug becomes a TODO with full context so the next agent doesn't re-investigate from scratch. |
| "Working tree is dirty but my changes are unrelated to QA." | /qa assumes a clean tree so the diff after the run is unambiguous. Commit or stash first; mixing makes regression-tracing impossible. |

## Red Flags

- A health score reported without before/after evidence.
- Multiple fixes squashed into one commit.
- A CI config or existing test modified during the run.
- A regression introduced by a fix and not reverted immediately.
- Deferred bugs without a corresponding `docs/todos/<slug>.md` and overview entry.
- The run claimed success without a final "ship readiness" summary.
- Sensitive data (cookies, tokens, user PII) leaked into screenshots or the report.

## Verification

A /qa run is DONE when:

- [ ] Working tree was clean at start (or the user explicitly chose stash/commit).
- [ ] Health scores were captured before and after, with the before/after delta in the report.
- [ ] Every fix landed as its own atomic commit on the working branch.
- [ ] No CI config or existing test file was modified.
- [ ] Deferred bugs each have a `docs/todos/<slug>.md` + overview entry.
- [ ] Fixed bugs that were existing TODOs got their detail file deleted and a Done-recent line in overview.
- [ ] Final summary block (ship-readiness verdict + remaining risks) was emitted.
- [ ] If `--report-only`, no fix commits exist.
