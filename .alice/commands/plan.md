# Feature Plan — Interactive Spec Builder

Interactive spec creation for a new non-trivial feature. Drives the user through the spec fields, scaffolds the plan folder under `docs/plans/active/`, and wires the backlog item in `docs/todos/overview.md`. Output is a locked spec ready for `/plan-eng-review`.

Use this command **before writing production code** for any feature that meets the non-trivial threshold in `.claude/rules/feature-spec-required.md`. For known issues / bug investigations, use `/investigate` instead — that skill drives the root-cause loop and can reuse the plan-folder scaffold at the end of this doc.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` = short slug hint (optional). E.g. `/plan wallet-rotation` → slug = `wallet-rotation`. If empty, derive slug from the feature name after Step 2.

## Flow

### 1. Read context

- `docs/wiki/current-status.md` — what's shipped / in flight.
- `docs/todos/overview.md` — existing Backlog entries (and any matching `docs/todos/<slug>.md` detail file).
- `.claude/rules/feature-spec-required.md` — confirm the threshold applies.
- `.claude/templates/{overview,spec,decision,implementation,todo}.md` — scaffolds to copy.

If the feature is **one-file / trivial** per the rule's exceptions, tell the user, stop, and suggest skipping the spec.

### 2. Elicit the feature shape (AskUserQuestion)

Ask the user in short, focused prompts. One field at a time — do not dump the full template. Cover in order:

1. **Feature name** — one line.
2. **Problem** — what's broken or missing, why now (1–2 paragraphs).
3. **Goal** — one sentence, observable "done" state.
4. **Scope (in)** — bullets. Prompt: "What is explicitly in scope?"
5. **Scope (out)** — bullets. Prompt: "What might a reader assume is in scope but isn't?"
6. **Acceptance criteria** — bullets, "given X when Y then Z" shape. Observable + testable.
7. **Design sketch** — short narrative. Primitives reused, primitives added, shape of the change. Grep ledger, archive, wiki before asking — surface prior art to the user.
8. **Assumptions** — bullets. Prompt: "What are you taking as true but haven't confirmed?" Push hard here — implicit assumptions are where most plans go wrong. If the user says "none", propose 2–3 likely candidates yourself based on the design sketch and ask them to confirm or correct.
9. **Verification map** — for each implementation step the design sketch implies, name a concrete verify check (failing test, command output, screenshot diff, assertion, migration dry-run). Prompt: "How will you know each step landed?" Fill the table in `spec.md`. If a step has no clear verify, that's a signal to split or rethink the step.
10. **Risks** — concrete, not "might be slow".
11. **Open questions** — anything that must be decided before locking.

**Step 2 discipline:**

- **Codebase-first.** If a question can be answered by reading the code, read the code — don't burn a user turn on it. Surface what you found ("`OrderService.cancel` already short-circuits when `status === 'shipped'`; should the new path do the same?"), then ask only what's still ambiguous.
- **Sharpen overloaded terms.** When the user uses a word that already has a definition in `docs/wiki/domain-model.md` — or one that clearly maps to two distinct concepts — propose the canonical term and confirm before writing it into the spec. Synonym drift in the spec becomes synonym drift in the code. If the term isn't in the wiki yet but matters for this feature, flag it as an open ambiguity and offer to add it to `domain-model.md` after sign-off.
- For each field, if the user's answer is thin (< 1 sentence for narrative fields, 0 bullets for list fields), push back once with a specific prompt before accepting.

### 3. Ledger + archive sweep (before writing)

Run these before creating the folder:

```bash
# Prior features in this area
rg -l "<feature-keyword>" docs/plans/archive/ docs/ledger/

# Decisions that touch the primitive(s)
rg "<primitive>" docs/ledger/decisions.md

# Prior burns on this primitive
rg "<primitive>" docs/ledger/experiences.md
```

Surface hits to the user — link them in the spec's **References** section.

### 4. Scaffold the folder + TODO detail file

```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
SLUG="<slug-from-arg-or-derived>"
DIR="docs/plans/active/${DATE}_${SLUG}"
mkdir -p "$DIR" docs/todos
cp .claude/templates/overview.md       "$DIR/overview.md"
cp .claude/templates/spec.md           "$DIR/spec.md"
cp .claude/templates/decision.md       "$DIR/decision.md"
cp .claude/templates/implementation.md "$DIR/implementation.md"
[ -f "docs/todos/${SLUG}.md" ] || cp .claude/templates/todo.md "docs/todos/${SLUG}.md"
```

Do NOT copy a plan folder if it already exists — ask the user whether to reuse, rename, or abort. The TODO detail file is `[ -f ] || cp` because it may have been created earlier when the user logged the TODO.

### 5. Fill `spec.md`

Write the user's answers into the copied template. Preserve section order. Set:
- `Status: draft`
- `Owner: <user or agent>`
- `Created: <date>`
- `Locked:` blank (filled after `/plan-eng-review` sign-off)

Fill `overview.md` with a 2–3 sentence problem + one-sentence goal + `Status: spec in review`. Leave `decision.md` and `implementation.md` as their template content — they fill during build.

### 6. Wire the TODO

Two files to touch:

**a) `docs/todos/<slug>.md` (per-TODO detail file).**

If `docs/todos/<slug>.md` already exists (the TODO was logged earlier), open it and:
- Set `Status: In flight` if the user is starting now (else leave `Backlog`).
- Set `Plan folder: docs/plans/active/<folder>/`.
- Cross-reference the spec from the detail file's **References**.

If it doesn't exist, copy `.claude/templates/todo.md` to `docs/todos/<slug>.md` and fill it from the user's answers in Step 2 (What = problem, Why = goal, Context = design sketch + risks + open questions). Set `Plan folder:` and `Status:` per above.

**b) `docs/todos/overview.md` (the index).**

- Add a one-liner under `## Backlog` if not already there:
  `- **[Px]** [<feature-name>](<slug>.md) — one-line description. Effort S/M/L.`
- If user confirms they're starting now, move that line to `## In flight`.

Do not duplicate the long context into `overview.md` — that's what the per-TODO file is for.

### 7. Handoff

Print a summary to the user:

```
Spec scaffolded: docs/plans/active/<folder>/spec.md
TODO detail:     docs/todos/<slug>.md
Overview index:  docs/todos/overview.md (entry under <Backlog | In flight>)
Status: draft

Next steps:
  1. Review the spec — edit docs/plans/active/<folder>/spec.md directly.
  2. Run /plan-eng-review to lock architecture, error handling, logging, tests.
  3. After sign-off: set spec Status to "locked", then start implementation.
```

Do NOT invoke `/plan-eng-review` automatically — let the user read the spec first and ask.

## Issue-investigation variant

When `/investigate` surfaces a bug that needs a plan (non-trivial fix, schema change, cross-module reproduction, etc.), reuse this command's scaffold:

1. `/investigate` finishes Phase 1–2 with a root-cause hypothesis.
2. Call `/plan <slug>` with slug like `fix-<component>-<symptom>`.
3. Fill **Problem** with the root-cause summary from investigate.
4. Fill **Scope** with the fix surface and test additions.
5. Link the investigation notes under **References**.

This keeps bug fixes and features on the same rails — both end up in `docs/plans/active/` with a spec → review → implement → retro lifecycle.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't** start coding before the spec is locked. Caught in review means redo.
- **Don't** skip the ledger/archive sweep. Re-burning a prior pattern is the top failure mode.
- **Don't** dump the full template at the user and ask them to fill it — interactive field-by-field is the contract.
- **Don't** auto-invoke `/plan-eng-review`. The user owns the read-through first.
